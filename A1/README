The following commands demonstrate the java version and make command. The current Makefile is required for
the make file to execute.

> java -version
openjdk version "9-internal"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 9-internal+0-2016-04-14-195246.buildd.src)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 9-internal+0-2016-04-14-195246.buildd.src, mixed mode)

> make
rm -f client.class server.class
javac client.java server.java


This program is executed in the school linux.cs.uwaterloo.ca environment. In order to execute the server, simply use the following command:

> ./server.sh <req_code>

Here, <req_code> is the integer code required by the client in order to reverse a string. A lack of this code, or it being in a non-integer format, will result in an error. Note that any additional provided parameter will be ignored.

In order to execute the client, simply use the following command:

> ./client <server_addr> <n_port> <req_code> <string>

In order for this command to work:
- server_addr, n_port and req_code must be provided.
- n_port and req_code must be integers

Note that any additional provided parameter will be ignored.
Executing the server correctly will result in a n_port printed out, which must be used here in order to communicate to it. 
The appropriate req_code must also be provided for the server to authenticate the request.
Note that a lack of string paramter will be assumed as an empty string, and will be treated as such.


Upon server receiving a request to reverse a string, it prints out the TCP_PORT on which the string is sent, along with the string sent to it.
The client will receive a reversed string, which it prints and exits.

Note that an incorrect req_code will result in no action, and so the client socket will time out.
